      <description>Aim Build a script that fetches data about who&amp;rsquo;s on support each week and post it to Slack every Monday morning
Tech Stack  Python Slack incoming webhooks google spreadsheet api Amazon AWS Lambda  Tutorial level: intermediate
Little background story Currently at work, we have a weekly support rota system where we rotate support amongst each member of the team. This information is stored in some Google sheets on the cloud and in order to find out who&amp;rsquo;s on support each week you will have to manually check the sheet.</description>
